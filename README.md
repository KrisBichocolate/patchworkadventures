# Patchwork Adventures

The goal of this project is to create tools, datapacks, mods for Java Minecraft 1.21.1 that create an experience similar to the one seen on the Misadventures SMP.

## Markers Datapack

The markers datapack provides tools for dealing with marker entities. Marker entities come up a lot when populating dungeons or points of interest and the idea is to simplify their handling.

After installation, trigger the main menu with
```
/function pwa_markers:menu
```
to create new marker types, get placement tools, go into edit mode or change settings.

### Building

The datapack is written with beet and bolt. Install [beet](https://github.com/mcbeet/beet) and run `beet build` to build it.

## Effects-lib Datapack

Work in progress on making it easier to build marker-based effects. Complex because it has to be a datapack-generator.
